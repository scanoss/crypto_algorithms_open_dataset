# crypto_algorithms_open_dataset project FAQ

This is the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document

## About the project

### What is crypto_algorithms_open_dataset project?

crypto_algorithms_open_dataset is an effort to standardize the declaration of cryptography algorithms in your software composition.
To achieve such goal, the first step is to enumerate and describe each one of the algorithms, which is the target of this dataset.

SCANOSS has published a first set of algorithms detected in published open source with their scanning and mining technology, including the keywords that were used to detect them. Each one of the algorithms includes a "definition", which is an initial attempt to reach a consensus on how to declare them.

In addition, and based on those definition, crypto_algorithms_open_dataset includes a script anyone can use to detect these crypto algorithms, as a way to test the algorithms list and their definition and to help in their  detection.

The combination of the crypto algorithms list, the definition for each one of them, the specification behind the definition and the software to detect them is what we call crypto_algorithms_open_dataset.

### Who created and maintains this project?

crypto_algorithms_open_dataset project was released by SCANOSS and it is currently maintained by this company.

### What is the goal and motivations behind the project

SCANOSS has published this contribution as a trigger to initiate a shared effort to standardize how cryptography algorithms are declared. The aim of SCANOSS is to donate this data set to a vendor neutral organization as a way to create a community together with industry players, cryptographers, key organizations and experts in standardization.

### What is the license of the project?

crypto_algorithms_open_dataset was released under CC0 licenses (open data). The detection software was released under MIT license.

### What is the governance model of the project?

Until the donation to a vendor neutral organization is done, the project is a company driven project where contributing to it is extremely easy, as in any other open source or open data project created and maintained by SCANOSS.
