# Introduction

This folder contains a set of YAML files which define all the available cryptographic algorithms to be used when
searching for hints inside source files.

Each YAML file defines one algorithm with the following:
```yaml
algorithmId: id
algorithmName: name
securityStrength: strength-of-the-algorithm
keywords:
    - list-of
    - keywords-to
    - search-for
```
