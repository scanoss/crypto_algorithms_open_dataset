# Contributing
Thank you for considering contributing. Feel welcome and read the following sections
in order to know how to get involved, ask questions and more importantly how to work on something.

SCANOSS is an open source project, and we love to receive contributions from our community.
There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests, or writing code.
A welcome addition to the project is an integration with a new source code repository.

### Pull requests

Want to submit a pull request? Great! But please follow some basic rules:

- Write a brief description that help us understand what you are trying to accomplish: what the change does, link to any relevant issue
- If you are changing a source file please make sure that you only include in the changeset the lines changed by you (beware of your editor reformatting the file)
- If you are adding functionality, please write a unit test.
